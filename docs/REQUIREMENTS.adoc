*Acceptance Criteria*
- *Given* QR mode is enabled and the agent has a Lightning Address
- *When* I choose a preset and click **Tip by QR**
- *Then* I see a QR and a copyable BOLT11 or LNURL-pay string
- *And* I see basic instructions for completing the payment
- *And* I can click **I’ve paid** to acknowledge completion

== Feature: Tip via NWC

- *When* the panel loads for a ticket with an assigned agent
- *Then* the app uses that field to resolve the payout address
